			First of all, Tristan served as a programmer at Sonnet Business Systems Limited, cooperating and communicating with different medical institutions in Greater China, vendors and suppliers in Hong Kong. One of the usersâ€™ requirements was to develop and test medical software with Delphi. The medical systems could help the clients manage their blood samples, perform data analysis, compute the data, and so on. Both the front-end and the back-end systems were developed by him.
